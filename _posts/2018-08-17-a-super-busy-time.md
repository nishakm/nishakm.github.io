## A mid 2018 year review of all the things that I have been doing

I seem to keep biting off more than I can chew. It may be because I do not keep track of all the things I bite off. So here is a list of all the things I have done since the last time I posted:

- I am the maintainer of an Open Source project called [Tern](https://github.com/vmware/tern) which is interesting in ways that I didn't think would appeal to me.
- I traveled to a bunch of conferences to talk about the project
    - [OSLS 2018](http://sched.co/DjsW)
    - [PyCon 2018](https://us.pycon.org/2018/community/sprints/)
    - [DockerCon 2018](https://2018.dockercon.com/)
- I worked with the DC503 team in creating their [party badge](https://twitter.com/theDawgCr8/status/1027793044987244545) based on the [design I did for DefCon25](http://nishakm.github.io/engineering/defconbangle/)
- I did a good bit of prep and ran the [Spartan Sprint Race](https://www.spartan.com/en/race/learn-more/race-types-overview?article=1)

Of course all this work is included on top of the necessary but never acknowledged work of taking care of a small child. And so I am going to list those as well.

- I scheduled kiddo's soccer, martial arts and guitar classes for the rest of the school year, the summer and the upcoming school year
- I had to speak to his teacher a lot this year as she seemed to not be able to translate all of what she planned to do into actual work.
- I cleaned and reorganized the living room.
- I grew some herbs and cooked with them.

And while I am at it, let me acknowledge all of the work that I do on a regular basis to keep this ship afloat

- Cook breakfast, lunch and dinner
- Clean the kitchen
- Do the laundry
- Feed cats
- Take out garbage
- Clean the toilets

This is a lot of work, so I think I can be excused for not posting on a blog for a while. It's not like I have fans anyway ;)
