## A weekend project to create a blinky bangle for DefCon 2017

A few weeks back I had posted details on a weekend project I had put together for a friend. [Check it out!](http://nishakm.github.io/engineering/defconbangle/)

As for why I haven't posted in a long while, my work life has drastically changed. It's definitely an improvement but it is a very busy and hectic life. Part of the improvement has been that I have gotten to write more. There have been some drawbacks to this. I hope to write a blog post about it soon.

I definitely need more discipline with respect to writing these blog posts. Quite frankly, balancing the new work responsibilities, childcare and professional growth has been a challenge to say the least. To my credit, the job is still pretty new. I probably need more time to get the hang of it and adjust all of my workloads and schedules accordingly. Maybe I would have the good sense to write a blog post as thoughts are fresh in my mind.

I suppose there is some kind of fire under my butt to do this as I have been plugging my website more than usual, thanks to the DefCon 2017 bangle.
