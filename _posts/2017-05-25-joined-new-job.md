## I joined VMWare and other things

I have to be honest about this - I still cannot believe that I now have a new job. I had only been at my previous job for a year. I hope this does not become a habit. Changing jobs is time consuming and expensive!

There is the other nagging feeling that I don't deserve it and I am just a diversity hire. Yes, I have a bad case of Imposter Syndrome. It bothers me to no end and I should try some way of snuffing it.

In other news it has been a rather busy month, so I didn't get much time to work on the blinky bracelet project. However, I hope I can accomplish something over this weekend and I will be able to put up a new blog post about it.

NOTE TO SELF: update the 'about' part of the website to reflect the new gig.
