title: F it I'm Writing About Work
desc: I work a lot so I might as well write about it

Here's something that I have come to realize over the past year: I work alot and it's all very interesting. I also signed some legally binding documents that have conflict of interest verbiage in them that I don't want to mess with. I like my job way too much to get into trouble for something like that.

However, I think I have a reasonable amount of common sense to know when something is a conflict of interest. I almost exclusively work on Open Source Software (and Hardware) which, by definition, shouldn't have any conflict of interest.

I also stumble along while learning about things and documenting it here (on my personal blog) might be useful to myself or other people.

So I am going to ask forgiveness instead of permission and go ahead and put some stuff here.
