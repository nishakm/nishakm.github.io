## Work

I currently work at [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) in their Open Source Program Office.

My focus is on containers, specifically creating OSS compliant containers. To this end I maintain a project called [Tern](https://github.com/vmware/tern). I have spoken at several events about this subject. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nishakmr/) to find out more. 


I used to work at Jaguar Land Rover in Portland, OR.
My work there included:

- Qt/QML programming for car infotainment
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery automation
- Platform Integration (mostly ARM and x86 with Linux)
- System Architecture
- Random assignments involving writing code in C++, Java and python

A long time ago, I worked at Intel at the Jones Farm site in Hillsboro, OR.

I worked for 3 years on Intel's Android project. I learned everything I know about Open Source ins and outs, build systems, DevOps and Git while I was employed here.

In the distant past I used to be an RF (Radio Frequency) Engineer. I changed my career to Software for reasons. I consider myself to be good at both.

## Non-Work

I like to do several things with the time that I don't spend taking care of my child. These include, in no particular priority, electronics projects, hardware hacking, knitting, fitness things, hiking, camping and going on road trips.
