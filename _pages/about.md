## Work

I currently work at VMWare but I reside in Portland OR.

I am in the Open Source Program office where I work on tools to support Open Source work at VMWare. I am currently on tools for Docker container users.


I used to work at Jaguar Land Rover in Portland OR.
I did systems engineering. That included:

- Qt/QML programming for car infotainment
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery automation
- Platform Integration (mostly ARM and x86 with Linux)
- System Architecture
- Random assignments involving writing code in C++, Java and python

A long time ago, I worked at Intel at the Jones Farm site in Hillsboro OR.

I worked for 3 years on Intel's Android project. I learned everything I know about Open Source ins and outs while I was employed here.
